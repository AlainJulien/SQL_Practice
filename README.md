# SQL_Practice
Just me practicing SQL and posting. If anyone has more efficient ways please feel free to comment.

This was me wanting to practice SQL on datasets found on the internet. The link below comprises of open data sets and various questions that where asked which allowed for practice.

The original link to the data is posted on the site as well.

Note each challenge increases in difficulty testing depth of SQL abilities which is great for beginners or refreshers.
